<h2>Build a Shopping List App</h2>
<p>Designing and coding a project from scratch: a shopping list</p>
<h3>Basic Requirements are:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Users should be able to enter items they need to purchase.</li>
	<li>Users should be able to check and uncheck items on the list (you don't necessarily need to use checkboxes for this, but there should be a way of visually distinguishing between purchased and unpurchased items).</li>
	<li>Users should also be able to permanently remove items from the list.</li>
</ul>
